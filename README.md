## My Approach
Just as I was really starting to feel like I was understanding Flexbox --truly understanding it-- for the first time, I decided to step outside my comfort zone and try to learn CSS Grid. I knew the basics, but I had a nagging feeling that I had to dig deeper, which made me think this would be a frustrating exercise. To my surprise, I loved my time spent with Grid and really learned to appreciate how it makes complex layouts simple to implement. I still see the beauty of Flexbox, and I love its utility, but now I see that it has a very specific purpose. CSS Grid does the heavy lifting, while Flexbox gets into the places where CSS Grid just can't.

## Challenges
I actually had a lot of challenges and this project took longer than I assumed it would. In addition to CSS Grid, I knew I wanted to serve images in a responsive way, factoring device dimensions while keeping file sizes low. That said, responsive images are hard, and I read and experimented a lot before I could really understand what image attributes like `srcset` and `sizes` really do.
